# General info
[![](https://yt-embed.live/embed?v=6APSnu8RWNE)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6APSnu8RWNE "Tiny RGB Ghost Light")

## Code
- This DIY electronic light is a good example of working with PWM pins. 
- The rainbow colours are achieved by maximising and minimising the values of the individual LEDs, which we do using a for loop. 
- With the colourToLED function we send the respective value to the LEDs. 

## Hardware
- The wiring is as simple as it gets. The light runs on an ATtiny25.
- We added three 3mm LEDs in red, green and blue to mimic the RGB LEDs and added 100 Î© resistors for the LEDs.
- The light is powered by a button cell battery.
